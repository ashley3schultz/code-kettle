                As an experienced project manager, I wore many hats and worked on multiple projects in any given week. I juggled new product development, business planning and budget creation on a weekly basis. In an effort to help my team successfully meet their goals, I journeyed into programming in order to automate several repetitive tasks and save valuable time. A whole new world opened up and I quickly fell in love with programming. The whole process was an intriguing puzzle reaching areas of my soul that needed a voice. I found I was leveraging my strengths in thinking critically, problem solving, continual learning, and building practical solutions. These discoveries lead me to change the direction of my career and I enrolled in a coding boot camp where I learned the programming fundamentals along with Ruby on Rails and React/Redux. During my time in school I built several applications and since graduating, I have continued to learn and put my skills to use both personally and as a freelance developer.
