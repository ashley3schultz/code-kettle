                Ashley is a passionate Full Stack Web Developer with an insatiable passion for learning and the pursuit of excellence in every area of my life and I was excited to see your posting for a Full Stack Web Developer. I live in beautiful Montana and I love being outdoors in the mountains and I am also one of those nerds that enjoys spreadsheet, and geeking out over anything programming.
                I have a dynamic background in product research and development and a few years ago I realized how much easier my work-life would be if I automated several tasks. Along the way I accidentally fell in love with programming. I realized I love every bit of the process from problem solving, learning new skills, and especially building practical solutions.
